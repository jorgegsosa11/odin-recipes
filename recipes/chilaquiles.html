            <li>¾ cup shredded pepper Jack cheese</li>
            <li>¾ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <p>8 servings</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place tomatillos, onion, cilantro, poblano pepper, jalapeño pepper, garlic, mint, and salt in a blender; blend until smooth.
                Transfer to a saucepan; bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until thickened, stirring often, about 10 minutes.
                Stir in chicken; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes more. 
            </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry tortilla strips, in batches, until crisp and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Layer 1/2 fried tortilla strips in a 2-quart baking dish; spread 1/2 tomatillo sauce over top. 
                Combine pepper Jack cheese and Monterey Jack cheese in a bowl; sprinkle 1/2 on tomatillo sauce. Repeat layers.   
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool before serving, about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
